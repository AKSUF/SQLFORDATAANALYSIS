## 🌐 What the Data Life Cycle Is
The **data life cycle** describes the journey data takes from its creation (or capture) until its eventual archival or deletion. It’s a framework that highlights both:
- **States of data** (raw → cleaned → prepared → analyzed → archived).  
- **Operations applied** (acquisition → storage → cleaning → analysis → preservation).  

The book emphasizes that data, like crude oil, must be refined before it becomes useful.

## 🔄 Stages and Operations Explained

### 1. **Data Acquisition / Capture**
- Collecting raw data from experiments, sensors, transactions, or opportunistic sources.  
- Raw data is not “neutral” — it reflects sampling choices, biases, and collection methods.  
- Metadata (descriptions of the dataset) may or may not be present at this stage.

### 2. **Data Storage**
- Placing raw data into databases, files, or warehouses.  
- Ensures persistence and accessibility for later steps.  

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) / Profiling**
- First look at the dataset to understand attributes, distributions, and quality.  
- Validates metadata (if available) or helps generate it.  
- Uses visualization (histograms, plots) and descriptive statistics to detect issues.

### 4. **Data Cleaning / Wrangling**
- Fixing problems like:  
  - **Missing values** (NULL, NA, or implicit gaps).  
  - **Outliers** (values far outside expected ranges).  
  - **Duplicates** (multiple records referring to the same entity).  
- Produces **clean data**, but not yet ready for analysis.

### 5. **Data Preparation / Pre-processing**
- Transforming data into analysis-ready formats:  
  - Normalization, scaling, standardization.  
  - Converting types (e.g., discretization, binarization).  
  - Restructuring datasets (pivoting, denormalization).  
- Ensures compatibility with statistical and machine learning tools.

### 6. **Data Analysis**
- Applying statistical, data mining, or machine learning techniques.  
- Generates insights, confirms or rejects hypotheses, and may trigger iterative cycles of re-analysis.

### 7. **Archival / Preservation**
- Once analysis is complete, data and results are either:  
  - **Purged** (deleted), or  
  - **Archived** (stored long-term for reproducibility or future use).  
- Metadata must accompany archived data to preserve meaning and context.
